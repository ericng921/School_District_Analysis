# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
### Purpose of the analysis

In the previous module practice, we had done a comprehensive school district analysis based on the two datasets - schools_complete and students_complete. However, the school board had noticed that the math and reading grades for Thomas High School (THS) ninth grades appear to have been altered. The purpose of the analysis is that we need to replace the 9th reading and math scores with NaN and to obtain updated results.

After replacing the ninth-grades scores we calculated the new student count for all the school without 9th grade student. Based on the new student account we got the passing percentages for math and reading, overall passing percentage, new district summary, new school summary with updated Thomas High School 10th to 12th grades only. 

In addition, we obtained the top 5 and bottom 5 overall passing results, new math and reading score in new dataframe for each grade from each school using groupby function, scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type through spending bins method for a deeper analysis.

## Results:

- How is the district summary affected?

  The district summary has a minor impact because there are only 461 THS 9th grade student excluded compare to a total of 39170 students in 15 schools.
